## Project Overview 
Group 5-UDC-Seneca is a group of students from the Universidade da Coruna in A Coruna, Spain and Seneca Polytechnic in Toronto, Canada who are working together through the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) program. During their collaboration, Group-5-UDC-Seneca develop and document, using the Agile project management approach, an online linear regression software application in GitHub. In doing this, the students are learning about
- linear regression modeling
- artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of linear regression modeling
- industry standards and expectations for software development
- industry standards and expectations for software documentation
- Agile working environments
- soft skills needed to collaborate effectively and efficiently despite different geographical regions, cultures, and languages.  

### About Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL)
The COIL approach supports cultural awareness, cultural competency, and globalization in the modern economy. It does this by pairing professors and their classes at two different accredited institutions in two different countries or cultures to work on a collaborative learning project. The professors collaborate on the planning and design of the project. The students then collaborate on organizing, discussing, completing, and presenting their project with the assistance of technology that supports their meeting and communicating virtually. Along the way, the students get to know and trust each other and work together comfortably and effectively even though they are in different geographic locations, may have language barriers and cultural differences, and are often in different time zones. 

### Project Purpose and Goals
Group 5-UDC-Seneca received the following instructions for their collaborative learning project:

> A client contacts your development team and tells you:

> "I want to hire you to make an application that allows me to create and visualize simple and multiple linear regression models from data stored in csv, excel, and databases (SQLite) files, and make predictions with them. I also want it to allow me to save the models, load them, and make predictions. The application musth have a graphical interface that allows me to do all of the above."

Group 5-UDC-Seneca understand that besides creating the application (app) described, their goals for the project also include working together to create the app efficiently and in accordance with scheduled project deadlines using Agile development principles, just as they would in real life for a real business client.

### Target Audience
In planning the app, Group 5-UDC-Seneca decided to target as broad an audience as possible. They wanted to ensure users understood the app was versatile and not limited to certain datasets or certain fields of study. For example, the app can be used to estimate the market price of a house based on number of bedrooms. A realtor could use the app for that purpose. The app can also be used to predict food consumption in a restaurant based on average age of the patrons. A restauranteur could find the app very helpful for that study. 

Also, they wanted to ensure non-technically-proficient users could use the app as easily as users who are very tech-savvy. An app that is complicated to use or assumes prior experience with similar apps would undesirably limit the size of the target audience. 

To meet the goal of making the app appropriate and easy to use for as many people as possible, Group 5-UDC-Seneca implemented a simple graphical interface with simple labels and descriptions along with optional tooltips. The simple visuals, labels, and descriptions do not suggest that the app is more suited for any one dataset or another. The tooltips, when activated, display additional information and guidance for less-technically-proficient users but otherwise do not clutter the interface or get in the way of advanced users who do not need that information.
