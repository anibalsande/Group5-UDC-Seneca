## Project Overview 
Group 5-UDC-Seneca is a group of students from the Universidade da Coruna in A Coruna, Spain and Seneca Polytechnic in Toronto, Canada who are working together through the Collaborative Online International Learning (COIL) program. During their collaboration, Group-5-UDC-Seneca develop and document, using the Agile project management approach, an online linear regression software application in GitHub. In doing this, the students are learning about
- linear regression modeling
- artificial intelligence and machine learning in the context of linear regression modeling
- industry standards and expectations for software development
- industry standards and expectations for software documentation
- working in Agile environments
- soft skills needed to collaborating across geographical regions, cultures, and languages.

urpose and Scope of LRM App Project

Group 5 is tasked with making an app allowing users
- to create and visualize simple, and if possible, multiple linear regression models from data stored in .csv, excel and SQLite databases
- to save the models, load them, and make predictions from them.

The app must have a graphical interface that lets the user do all the above.
