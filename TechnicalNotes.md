### Scope of LRM App Project

Group 5 is tasked with making an app allowing users
- to create and visualize simple, and if possible, multiple linear regression models from data stored in .csv, excel and SQLite databases
- to save the models, load them, and make predictions from them.

The app must have a graphical interface that lets the user do all the above.
