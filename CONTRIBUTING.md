#CONTRIBUTING
## Branching
Development takes place in the “develop” branch. 
If a development feature requires multiple commits before it is fully functional, create a new branch from “develop”. This will help keep the main development branch (“develop”) stable while you work on the feature or fix. Once your work is complete, open a pull request (PR) to merge your changes back into the develop branch.


## Commit Guidelines
Use short and descriptive commit messages.
All commit messages and code comments should be in English so everyone can understand them.
If your commit completes a User Story, start the commit with the story number, like this: “#10 Data Import from Files”.
If a commit is ready to be the one shown in the sprint review, even though further changes may be made later, the coomit should be like "Sprint 5". This allowed us to keep track of the version to be presented during the sprint review, while still enabling additional improvements or modifications to be made in subsequent commits.
