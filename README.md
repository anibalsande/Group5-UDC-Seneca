App for creating, visualizing, and predicting linear regression models.

I want to hire you to develop an application that will allow me to create and visualise simple [and multiple] linear regression models based on data stored in csv files, excel files and databases (SQLite), and make predictions with them. Furthermore, I need to be able to load, store, and make predictions with the models. The application needs a graphical interface that will make it easy for me to do all of the above.
