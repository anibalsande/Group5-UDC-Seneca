## Overview
<!-- TO DO: Add link to accessible PDF of Quick Start Guide-->

App for creating, visualizing, and predicting linear regression models.

This application is designed to facilitate the creation, visualization, and prediction of linear regression models, supporting both simple and multiple linear regression. It provides a graphical interface that allows users to easily interact with the models, using data from various sources, including CSV files, Excel files, and SQLite databases.

## 1. Introduction
<!-- TO DO: Add more information about name of the app (LRM App?), motivation for app, the target audience, the problem it solves, what we learned -->

### What is the LRM App? 
The LRM App is a tool for analyzing data and making predictions from it. 

### How does the LRM App do this?
Using information from you and the power of artificial intelligence, the LRM App creates and visualizes simple and multiple linear regression models. These linear regression models let you analyze historical data patterns and from them predict future data patterns. 

### What is artificial intelligence?
Artificial intelligence, or AI, is defined as "a field of science concerned with building computers and machines that can reason, learn, and act in such a way that would normally require human intelligence or that involves data whose scale exceeds what humans can analyze." ([Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-artificial-intelligence#artificial-intelligence-defined))

### What is linear regression? 
Linear regression is one of the methods, or algorithms (a set of instructions), by which mathematicians can show statistical information and model relationships between variables. AI can perform the linear regression algorithm in a matter of milliseconds, whereas it would take a human significantly longer.  

### Is the LRM App hard to use?
No. The LRM App has an easy-to-use graphical interface and guides you through the entire data analysis and prection process, including
  - uploading your dataset from common formats like .CSV, Excel, and SQLite and addressing incomplete information
  - focusing on the datapoints from your dataset that are important to you
  - building a visual model and a graph of the data
  - displaying the mathematical formula and the expected accuracy of predictions
  - making predictions upon receiving new datapoints

The LRM App also lets you save and reload your models quickly, making it indispensable for your research needs.    

## 2. Getting started
Before you can use the LRM App, you will need to have the following software installed on your computer.
- Windows 10 or 11 operating system
- Python 3.13.0 or later
- C++ compiler

For help installing Python and a C++ compiler, see [System requirements](#system-requirements). 

### System requirements
If you do not already have Python and a C++ compiler installed on your Windows 10/11 computer, install these first using the instructions below before installing the LRM App.

**To install Python 3.13.0**
1. Download [Python](https://python.org/downloads/) for Windows from the [Python](https://python.org/downloads/) website.
2. In the initial installation window, select Customize installation (see Figure 1).
   Note: You do not need admin privileges when installing.

4. Select Next.
5. In the Advanced Options window, ensure that "Associate files with Python" and "Add Python to environment variables" are checked (see Figure 3).

6. Select Install and wait for the installation to finish.

**To install a C++ compiler**
1. Install [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
2. Under the heading Desktop & Mobile, select the Desktop development with C++ option on the installation menu (see Figure 2).
3. Ensure that the C++ CMake tools for Windows component is checked (see Figure 2).
